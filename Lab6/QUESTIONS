Question: How is the communication between the host and the graphic card handled?

Question: What function executes your kernel?
clEnqueueNDRangeKernel(commands, kernel, 1, NULL, &global, &local, 0, NULL, NULL);

Question: How does the kernel know what element to work on?
get_global_id(0);

Question: How much data did you put in local (shared memory)?
__local unsigned char shared[BLOCK_SIZE+KERNELSIZE*2][BLOCK_SIZE+KERNELSIZE*2][3];
Our blocksize is 16. Our kernelsize is atm 10. * 2 = 20. 
16+20 = 36.
36*36*3 bytes (a char is 8 bits == 1 byte)

Question: How much data does each thread copy to local memory?
Depends on what thread is being utilized. Each thread handles about 1-4 pixels.

Question: How did you handle necessary overlap between work groups?
By syncing the shared array after doing the writes for each thread calling the function   
barrier(CLK_LOCAL_MEM_FENCE);

--Fast såhär är det inte. För den verkar bara synka mellan trådar i en singel work group

--Menas det att vi bestämmer ett index med hjälp av det globala id:et OCH det lokala id:et?


Question: If we would like to increase the block size, about how big work gropus would be safe to use in this case? Why?

Question: How much speedup did you get over the naive version?
