  QUESTION: How many cores will simple.cu use, max, as written? How many SMs?
  16 cores, one SM.

  QUESTION: Is the calculated square root identical to what the CPU calculates? Should we assume that this is always the case?
  Yes.

  QUESTION: How do you calculate the index in the array, using 2-dimensional blocks?
  int x = (blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x);
  int y = (blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y);
  int offset = x+y * 16;

  By calculating x and y independently from

  QUESTION: What happens if you use too many threads per block?
  If we have too many threads, we get an error saying invalid configuration. This is due to hardware limitations.
