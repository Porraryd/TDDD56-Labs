QUESTION: What timing did you get for your GPU reduction? Compare it to the CPU version.
On 10000000 elements
CPU time: 0.032240
GPU time: 0.332194

QUESTION: Try larger data size. On what size does the GPU version get faster, or at least comparable, to the GPU?
Sizes with 5 million or more..
QUESTION: How can you optimize this further? You should know at least one way.
QUESTION: Should each thread produce one output or two? Why?
QUESTION: How many items can you handle in one block?
QUESTION: What problem must be solved when you use more than one block? How did you solve it?
QUESTION: What time do you get? Difference to the CPU? What is the break even size? What can you expect for a parallel CPU version? (Your conclusions here may vary between the labs.)
